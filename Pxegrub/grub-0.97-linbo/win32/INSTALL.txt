INSTALL:
--------

	you need to compile these files under CYGWIN
	get GRUB, for example in the directory /usr/local/src/grub-0.97
	install these files in grub-0.97/win32
	run "make" in the win32 directory


Usage:
------

1) get a compiled stage1 and stage2 image and put these in C:\boot
   for example compiled on a linux machine

2) add the following line to the file C:\boot.ini

   C:\boot\stage1="GRUB"

   you may need to do 

	   ATTRIB -R -H -S C:\boot.ini

   to make the file visible and writable and 

	   ATTRIB +R +H +S C:\boot.ini

   to revert the attributes of the file

3) run w32grub
   This will update the embedded blocklists in the files stage1 and stage2

   You should rerun this utility after moving/changing the files stage1 or stage2
   and after running tools like defragmentation

   w32grub -d device -1 stage1 -2 stage2 -m menu
       -d (hd0,0)      : partition where the files are
       -1 C:/boot/stage1 : boot sector
       -2 C:/boot/stage2 : secondary boot loader
       -m /boot/grub/menu.lst : grub boot menu

       device must be a GRUB partition identifier
       stage1 and stage2 must be fullpaths(including drive letter) to win32 file names
